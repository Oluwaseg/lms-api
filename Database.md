# üìò LMS Database Documentation

This document explains the purpose of each table in the Learning Management System (LMS). It‚Äôs designed for developers, admins, and stakeholders to understand how data is structured and connected.

---

## 1. Roles & Users

### **roles**

Stores all registered accounts.
Includes profile info (`name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `picture`) and system details (`role_id`, `status`, verification flags).
`email` and `code` are indexed and unique in the schema.
Each user has a **unique code** (`STU12345`, `INS5678`, etc.) separate from their username.
Field names in the codebase: `is_verified` (boolean), `last_login` (timestamp), and `deleted_at` (nullable timestamp) are used to manage lifecycle and soft-deletes.

### **users**

### **verification_tokens**

Manages token verification used for email verification, password reset and onboarding flows.
The implementation stores only a hashed lookup value in `token_hash` (HMAC-SHA256 with a server secret) for security. The DB/entity does not store raw tokens in production; a temporary plaintext token column may exist during development/migrations but should be removed before production deployment.
Tokens include `type`, `expires_at`, `used` and `created_at` fields and are linked by `user_id`.

- Includes profile info (name, email, phone, address, picture) and system details (role, status, verification).

### **parents_children**

Links **parent accounts** to their **child/student accounts**.
Implemented with explicit foreign key columns named `parent_id` and `child_id` (matching the migration and entity join columns).
Includes `relationship` (e.g., father, mother, guardian) and `created_at` timestamp.
A unique constraint enforces that the same child cannot be linked multiple times to the same parent.

### **verification_tokens**

- Manages OTP/token verification (for email, password reset, onboarding).
- Tokens have expiration and usage status.

### **parents_children**

- Links **parent accounts** to their **child/student accounts**.
- Includes `relationship` (e.g., father, mother, guardian).
- Enforces uniqueness so the same child isn‚Äôt duplicated under the same parent.

---

## 7. Badges & Gamification

### **badges**

- Includes criteria and icon.

### **user_badges**

- Connects users with badges they‚Äôve earned.
- Stores timestamp of achievement.

---

## 8. Analytics

### **analytics**

- Stores recorded metrics per user (e.g., time spent, logins, lesson completions).
- Used for tracking student engagement and reporting.

---

## 9. Integrations

### **integrations**

- Configurable via JSON for flexibility.
- Tracks whether integration is enabled and when it was connected.

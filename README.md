## üóÇ Database & Models

The system uses a relational database with key tables:

- `users`, `roles`, `verification_tokens`
- `parents_children`
- `courses`, `enrollments`, `payments`
- `assignments`, `submissions`
- `progress`, `ratings`
- `forums`, `forum_posts`
- `notifications`
- `badges`, `user_badges`
- `analytics`
- `integrations`
- `audit_logs`

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

We‚Äôve designed a production-ready, scalable database schema to support all LMS features, including user roles, parent-child relationships, payments, analytics, and integrations.
